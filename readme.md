## What is this
Finance hub is a basic tool to manage your budgets and keep track of multiple accounts at the same time.
You can create multiple accounts, budgets and payments.
There are also monthly payments, but they don't really work well (**They don't!**).

### Budgets/Categories
You can create budgets/categories on the "Budgets" tab. After creating one, reload the page so it can be loaded in correctly (Will be automated soon).
Then, you can select the budget/category in multiple locations, including the payment adder or [[#QuickTransfer]]. On the budget page, you should now also see the budget and the sum of all payments with the corresponding category. The number turns red when the number is below 0.
### Payment list
This is pretty much self-explanatory. It just shows you all your payments, except for the monthly payments, which are shown on the bottom of the page.
It will show the amount, the category and the description of the payment. You can also edit/remove the payment with the buttons on the right.
### QuickTransfer
If you have some spare money left in one category, you can easily transfer it to another category using the QuickTransfer feature. To use it, head to the left sidebar and look for the "QuickTransfer" box.

Now, select the wished amount and the categories that should exchange the money.
To add the payment, click "Transfer!" and the payment will automatically be generated and added to the payment list and will look something like this:

### Data Import
You can probably export the payments from your online banking or somewhere else. You can import that data into finance-hub. To do so, head to the import page, and paste your descriptions, categories and amounts into the corresponding text boxes.
Then, simply hit "Import" and the payments will be imported.
### Multiple accounts
On the left sidebar you will find this box:
![[account_switcher.png]]
Here you can switch between your accounts. To add a new account, just type something in the text box below the selector and click the plus button. To switch to an account, select it and press the arrow button [>]. The page will reload and the account should be loaded.

Delete an account with the [X] after selecting it.
###### Important! Deleting an account can NOT be undone! All your configurations, payments and categories will be gone.
